14. Dr. Strange
Now while Dr. Strange may not possess the physical prowess of some of our earlier picks on the list, he doesn’t have to.
He is the Sorcerer Supreme, the magic man, the most powerful wizard in the world.
His command over magic is indomitable, allowing him to perform such feats as levitation, teleportation, time travel, astral projection, dimensional travel, and a host of other cool magical stuff.
His powers have varied greatly over the years, and at times has been difficult to define, but at his best, Strange can do almost anything.
He was the protector (and user) of the Time Stone, and let’s not forget that awesome living cape of his.
And yes, he has beaten Galactus in battle.
